# mClari Control Algorithm

This project involves the development of a control algorithm for the movement of the mClari robot using the MuJoCo physics engine and Gym environment. The algorithm is implemented and trained using Stable-Baselines3 (SB3).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following packages installed:

### 1. MuJoCo

MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) is a physics engine used for simulating robots and other complex physical systems.

To install MuJoCo, run:

```bash
pip install mujoco
'''
